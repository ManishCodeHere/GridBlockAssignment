Hello,

First of all, I would like to thank you for this opportunity and for selecting me for the test. While working through the questions, I learned a great deal, and as a fresher, I encountered many challenges that helped me clarify several doubts. I also referred to YouTube for guidance, which allowed me to better understand and solve the pathfinding question.

That particular question took a significant amount of time, and I encountered some bugs, which is why I wasn't able to fully complete it. However, the process has motivated me to work harder and learn new things.

Although I’m unsure if I’ll progress to the next round, this experience has sparked many new ideas for developing future projects and games.

Thank you again for this valuable learning opportunity.

Here’s how you can easily navigate through this test:

1. **Grid Block Generation**: Simply play the game to see the grid blocks being generated.
2. **Obstacles and Pathfinding**: After playing, go to the Hierarchy, select the "Obstacle Manager," and click "Generate" in the Inspector to generate obstacles.
3. **Enemy AI**: After playing, click on any grid to move the player and observe the Enemy AI in action.

**Miscellaneous**: The issue I encountered in the pathfinding question was that when I generated obstacles using a prefab, the player didn't recognize them as obstacles. However, when I manually placed an obstacle (like a cube), the player correctly identified it as an obstacle. I'm not sure what caused this issue. Thank you.
